                    Once in a while you should at things around you more
                    closely. They're not always what they seem. I really 
                    have no clue about what I should type in here and the
                    time is nigh, so I'm just going to type some random 
                    sentences in here.

                    A purple dragon once met a giant squirrel and she said 
                    she would craft him a pair of boots out of live rabbits.
                    He didn't believe her and told her he's allergic to 
                    fur anyway. Then he left. That's the end of the story.
